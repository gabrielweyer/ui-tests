# Puppeteer

`npm` package I'm using:

- [Puppeteer][npm-puppeteer]

**Note**: `Chrome` is not required as `Puppeteer` will install it.

## Configuration

I'm using environment variables to expose secrets to the tests.

Test `GitHub` account:

- `GITHUB_SIGNINCREDENTIALS_USERNAME` either the username or the email address
- `GITHUB_SIGNINCREDENTIALS_PASSWORD`

[npm-puppeteer]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer
