# Puppeteer

`npm` package I'm using:

- [Puppeteer][npm-puppeteer]

**Note**: `Chrome` is not required as `Puppeteer` will install it.

## Configuration

I'm using environment variables to expose secrets to the tests.

Test `Goodreads` account:

- `GABO_GOODREADS_SIGNINCREDENTIALS_EMAILADDRESS`
- `GABO_GOODREADS_SIGNINCREDENTIALS_PASSWORD`
